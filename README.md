**Meeting Times and Agendas:**
   - Agree on regular meeting times to accommodate everyone and stick to agendas to maximize efficiency.
   -  Be open to adjusting schedules when necessary, considering time zones and individual commitments.
   -  Meetings will be held at the same time as the workshops but on days that we do not have workshops considering team members commitments and time zone differences.

**Communication Channels:**
   -  All the project-related communication for our team will happen through the following platforms: Whatsapp, Slack, and Email.

**Respect:**
   - All members should demonstrate respectful considerations, such as active listening, acknowledging others' perspectives, and giving credit where it's due.
- it is important to address disrespectful behavior privately initially. If the issue is not resolved through private discussion it can be brought up in a group meeting.
